                        I'm Loc Nguyen, a software engineer and a fourth-year student at Can Tho University of
                        Technology. I'm currently seeking a backend developer position. My passion for coding drives me
                        to continuously learn and practice, always striving to improve my skills and grow as a
                        developer.
                        All the repositories youâ€™ll find here are the results of the fundamental knowledge I've gained
                        through my university studies and personal projects. Feel free to explore some of my work.
